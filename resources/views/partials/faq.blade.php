                        <span>How is AdivoQ different from regular accounting software?</span>
                        <i data-lucide="chevron-down"></i>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Traditional accounting software like Zoho or QuickBooks are designed for traditional businesses. AdivoQ is built specifically for the creator economy - with features like brand deal tracking, milestone-based invoicing, WhatsApp integration, and creator-specific tax calculations that regular software doesn't offer.</p>
